        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p class="fade-in">Simply ask the AI bot anything related to mental health and get insightful, well-researched answers. Whether you're looking for advice, coping strategies, or just need someone to talk to, our AI bot is here to help. We're working to ensure that mental well-being support is accessible anytime and anywhere.</p>
